                        Welcome to the Simon Says game, a memory challenge that will test your ability to remember and repeat patterns! The game presents a sequence of colors that light up, and your task is to click the same colors in the same order. Be careful, though — if you make a mistake, the game will end! <br>

<b>How to Play:</b><br>
<u>Start the Game</u> : Press any key to begin the game. The game will start with a random sequence of colors. <br>

<u>Follow the Sequence</u> : The game will flash the colors in a specific order. You must repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order. <br>

<u>Keep Going</u> : With each successful sequence, the game will increase in difficulty, adding another color to the sequence. <br>

<u>Game Over</u> : If you click the wrong color or order, the game will end, and your score will be displayed. Press any key to start again.

<br><b>Key Features:</b> 
Levels: The game increases in difficulty with each level.

Max Score: Try to beat your own high score as you progress through more levels!

Good luck, and remember — focus, follow the sequence, and don’t make a mistake!
